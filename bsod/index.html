            A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage<br>
            to your computer.<br>
            <br>
            The problem seems to be caused by the following file: SPCMDCON.SYS<br>
            PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA<br>
            <br>
            If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen,<br>
            restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow<br>
            these steps:<br>
            <br>
            Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.<br>
            If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer<br>
            for any Windows updates you might need.<br>
            <br>
            If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware<br>
            or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.<br>
            If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart<br>
            your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then<br>
            select Safe Mode.<br>
